âš¡ Fun fact:I created **OneNaut Multi-talented Discord Bot**.

# Discord Bot for All Needs. 

### OneNaut Discord bot is written NodeJs only **WITHOUT** using any 3rd party NPM packages.
Its code is 70% less than other bots and mainly recalled codes which makes it stable, faster and reliable. `Sharding` bit for more than 2000 servers is available too.
Join support server and `on.help` to begin.

Full Bot (Ready-to-host) will cost you `30$` (Bargaining-available) 
### Database Mongodb
