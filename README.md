## **OneNaut** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ github profile.
âš¡ Fun fact:I created **OneNaut Multi-talented Discord Bot**.

# Discord Bot Made in India.

### OneNaut Discord bot is written NodeJs only **WITHOUT** using any 3rd party NPM packages.
Its code is 70% less than other bots and mainly reused codes which makes it stable, faster and reliable
