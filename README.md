âš¡ Fun fact:I created **OneNaut Multi-talented Discord Bot**.

# Discord Bot for All Needs. 
[Summon Bot from Top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/783594136741609533)

### OneNaut Discord bot is written NodeJs only **WITHOUT** using any 3rd party NPM packages.
Its code is 70% less than other bots and mainly recalled codes which makes it stable, faster and reliable
